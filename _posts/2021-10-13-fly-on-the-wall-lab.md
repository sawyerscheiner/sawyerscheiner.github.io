# Fly on the Wall Lab

### Overview:
In this lab, we acted as if we were a "fly on a wall," observing daily life around Horace Mann, without interfering or being known. We spent time in class walking around the school taking notes on what we saw, and we also made our own observations outside of class time. Using these observations that we made about people, environments, objects, activities, etc. around campus, we can find potential ideas, or problems that may have to be solved. Eventually we can design something that will be able to solve these problems noted in the activity, but we will not be doing that today. 

### Observations:
- Field filled with activities, spikeball, soccer balls/goals, footballs, etc. 
- Tents with chairs and boards for potential outside classes.
- Bleachers for watching sports games, doing homework, or just hanging out with friends.
- Many people on field playing football, soccer, spikeball, volleyball, etc. Having fun.
- Hallways generally empty during class time.
- Between classes many people walking/running to class(depending on the time), standing outside classes, people on the stairways, talking to friends, on their phones, etc.
- In the library: people sitting quietly studying, people talking, people on their phones, people playing videogames, etc.

### Analysis:
I think that due to the amount of activities set up outside such as sports, the school clearly values student's happiness and allows for people to have fun during frees, lunch, or any other free time. Also, there are countless places inside and outside for students to do homework or even just sit with friends like the library, the bleachers, or the cafeteria. I think that the school wants to give us the freedom to be able to work and chill where we want, even across the whole campus.
Even in between classes, when the stairways and hallways are the busiest, they are generally navigable and it is easy to get to where you want to go. They may seem crowded, but the school has put plenty of effort into making sure that we are not overcrowded and have ample space to move around.
In addition to that, the school also puts effort into creating diverse spaces for all kinds of people. Example: the library, where you can go if you want to do homework or chill with your friends, or just to sit down, study, or even watch a tv show. 

### Process:
During this process of making these observations and studying them, I worked with Luke Peng([his website](https://lukepeng123.github.io/)) during class to observe the school and take observations about what we saw. We tried walking through the halls and looking around, but we did not see much except classrooms and empty hallways. We went outside onto the field where we saw plenty of people playing sports and studying during frees. I think something that could have gone a little better was the observing process, as we kind of just wrote down things we saw and could have been more structured. Nonetheless, we were still able to complete the lab.

### Conclusion:
During this lab, we learned a lot about the environment and atmostphere of Horace Mann. Maybe one day we will be able to use our skills in app development to make our community a better place.

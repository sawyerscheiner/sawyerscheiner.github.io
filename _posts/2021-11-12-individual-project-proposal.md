# Individual Project Proposal: Water Fountains at Horace Mann

  A problem present in our community at Horace Mann School that I have observed is that the water fountains buttons have been shut off and do not work. The only part of the water fountain that works is the bottle filling nozzle. I understand that this is to promote use of reusable water bottles and to prevent covid from spreading, but I think that this is a problem because not only does this prevent some people from getting water when they need it, but it also increases use of plastic bottles from the cafeteria, which counteracts the intention in the first place to reduce waste of water and plastic. 

  Let's say a student has a big test coming up, but they did not bring a water bottle, and they need a sip during class. They will not be able to get the hydration they need without using a plastic bottle and having to go all the way to the cafeteria, which they dont have time for during class or even between classes. This negatively affects the community more than it positively effects us, as many people do not have water bottles to fill up and drink. Plus, if the school really wanted to stop plastic waste they would stop offering plastic bottles. If the school would activate the water fountains and let students drink from them, we could reduce the use of plastic cups and bottles for water, and also help students get hydration easily whenever they need it, which benefits our community as a whole and hurts nobody.
